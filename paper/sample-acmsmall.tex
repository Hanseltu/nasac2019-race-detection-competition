\noindent{\textbf{ABSTRACT}}

%Interrupt-driven embedded software is widely used in safety critical systems such as aerospace, rail transit, and medical equipment. %In this paper, we designed a data race detection finite automaton model based on LLVM IR load/store instruction, which helps us to detect the defects in the single variable access sequence mode in the program. 
%Race conditions, occured due to interactions between application tasks and interrupt handlers, are triggered by the frequent using interrupts in these systems.
%To verify the validity of our model, we designed a tool called xx. The first step of this tool is to compile the source code into LLVM IR code. The second step is to model according to the load/store instruction in IR, and output the processing result after running.
%The experimental results show that our tool can effectively detect the four defects caused by the single variable access pattern in the code.
%Few works is focusing on the interrupt data race detection via variable access pattern search, not to mention the method based on LLVM. 
%In this paper, we design xxx, an automated framework that can detect race conditions in interrupt-driven embedded software.

Interrupt data race detection is critical for interrupt-driven software, 
since dangerous bugs may be caused by interrupt data race. In this paper, 
we propose a pattern search method to detect interrupt data race based on LLVM. 
First, we construct the behavor of the program related to the shared variable via 
the 'load' and 'store' instructions of LLVM. Then, a patter search algorithm is designed 
to detecte the bugy shared variable access pattern. We evaluate the proposed method on racebench, 
which reveals that the presented approach can precisely detect race conditions.
