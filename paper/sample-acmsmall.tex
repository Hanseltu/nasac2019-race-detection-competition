\noindent{\textbf{ABSTRACT}}

A clear and well-documented \LaTeX\ document is presented as an

or journal publication. Based on the ``acmart'' document class, this
article presents and explains many of the common variations, as well
as many of the formatting elements an author may use in the
preparation of the documentation of their work.
